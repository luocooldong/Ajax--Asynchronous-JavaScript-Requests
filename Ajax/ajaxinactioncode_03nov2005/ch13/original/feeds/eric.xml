          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Win a copy of Ajax in Action or a T-Shirt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone that has been reading my blog, I thought that I would share the contest I got started with the support of Manning and JavaRanch. We want you to help us create the slogan for our Ajax in Action T-Shirt! Below is the contest email that was sent out in the JavaRanch newsletter. If you are not a current member, sign on up!
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eric Pascarello
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Contest Details:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/
Our friendly bartender Eric Pascarello has a new book on Ajax coming out soon and the publisher,
Manning, is looking for some ideas for slogans for the book. Come up with something clever and
you could win a free MEAP Ebook copy of the book or a t-shirt!  Be the first on your block to
own a copy of what is sure to be a very interesting book.  Manning will choose the winner from
among the entries.  If a slogan is chosen, the first person who posted the slogan will win. If
Manning doesn&#039;t like any of the entries then one random winner will be chosen. Also two random
posters will be selected to win an Ajax in Action T-Shirt. Only one entry per person will be
considered for the random drawings. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you can not come up with a slogan, you still have a chance to win a t-shirt! Manning would
love to hear what you think about Ajax, what it means to you, how you have implemented it, and
so on. Our resident moderator and co-author of Ajax in Action, Eric Pascarello, will be in the
HTML and JavaScript forum like always to answer any questions you may have about Ajax or Ajax In
Action. Get your thinking caps on and start coming up with your best slogan ideas! 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You can take a look at the description of the book here:

&lt;a href=&#034;http://www.manning.com/books/crane&#034;&gt;http://www.manning.com/books/crane&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Read about the book, come up with a catchy slogan suitable for t-shirts and post it in our HTML
and JavaScript forum:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&#034;http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=20&amp;t=004837&#034;&gt;http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=20&amp;t=004837&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Legal stuff: All entries (no matter how awful) become the property of Manning. Contest Ends
Friday, August 26th at midnight MST.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sending XML to the Sever with AJAX</title>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sending XML to the Sever with AJAX&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A question that has come up to lately by people on &lt;a href=&#034;http://JavaRanch.com&#034;&gt;JavaRanch&lt;/a&gt; and emails I received is how do I send an XML to the server using Ajax. It is possible to send an XML document in the request parameter. One thing you need to make sure is that you set the header correctly to text/xml and post the document to the server. This following is a basic example that highlights the fact that we are not limited to just sending query string and form values to the server, which seems to be implanted into certain developerâ€™s minds. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://radio.javaranch.com/pascarello/2005/07/20/1121878017742.html"&gt;Read more...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
